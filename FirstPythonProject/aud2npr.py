#The main goal of the program is to convert NPR to AUD or AUD TO NPR.

Aud = 12345678
ConvertedAud= Aud*80.61

Npr= 12345678
ConvertedNpr = Npr/80.61

print "The AUD converted is : %f" %ConvertedAud # %f is a formatter for FLOAT hence the ConvertedToNpr will not show
print "The NPR converted is :%d " %ConvertedNpr
